        Developer who
        aspires to become a high
        caliber programmer
        working for large
        companies in the I.T.
        industry. I have experience
        in full-stack development.

        A large part of my life is computers and a passion for technology. I graduated from a fullstack Bootcamp where I learned many different topics in record time with great intensity.
        In addition to the bootcamp, I've been continuously expanding my knowledge through self-study.
        This combination of structured learning and self-directed education has allowed me to develop a comprehensive skill set.
        Some of the technologies I've been working with are...
