Development student who
aspires to become a high
caliber programmer
working for large
companies in the I.T.
industry. I have experience
in full-stack development.
A large part of my life is computers and a passion for technology. I recently graduated from a fullstack Bootcamp where I learned many different topics in record time with great intensity.
